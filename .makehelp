Make commands for ginput:

make help: print this help text

make install: install the ginput Python package and its dependencies.
    By default, this will create a conda environment named "ginput-py3"
    and install ginput and its dependencies there. This is the preferred
    method, as the package versions are frozen to ensure that ginput
    works correctly. You can change the environment name with the ENV
    argument, i.e. "make install ENV=my-env" will use "my-env" as the
    environment name.

    If you do not have conda installed, then this will fall back on
    standard Python 3 virtual environments. It will create the environment
    in this folder, named "ginput-py3-env" by default. The prefix, before
    the "-env" can be changed with the ENV argument.

    Once the install is complete, a "run_ginput.py" script will be
    placed in this directory. Executing it directly (i.e. "./run_ginput.py")
    will automatically use the correct environment without needing to
    activate it.

make test:
    Carries out full set of tests on ginput. Requires GEOS-FPIT data from
    2018-01-01 to be placed in ./ginput/testing/test_input_data/geosfp-it/Nv
    (met and chem on eta level files) and ./ginput/test_input_data/geosfp-it/Nx
    (2D data).

make quicktest:
    Carries out quick unit tests on ginput; does not require GEOS-FPIT data.
