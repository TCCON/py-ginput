usage: $0 ENVNAME

Installs ginput and its dependencies into a conda environment.

Creates a conda environment with the name ENVNAME and installs the
packages listed in environment.yml into it, then installs ginput
in develop mode. Alternatively, if the given environment already
exists, update it with the requirements in environment.yml.

Upon successful completion, a run_ginput.py script is created in this
directory. Executing this script as ./run_ginput.py will always use
the Python that ginput was installed with.

Example: install into "ginput-py3" environment
$0 ginput-py3
