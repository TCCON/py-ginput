.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
These subcommands download GEOS\-FPIT or GEOS\-FP data from NASA. These files are necessary inputs to ginput. Ginput
requires 3 files per time:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The 2D met variables (e.g. \fBGEOS.fpit.asm.inst3_2d_asm_Nx.GEOS5124.20180101_0000.V01.nc4\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
The 3D met variables on the native 72\-eta level grid (e.g. \fBGEOS.fpit.asm.inst3_3d_asm_Nv.GEOS5124.20180101_0000.V01.nc4\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
The 3D chemistry variables on the native 72\-eta level grid
(e.g. \fBGEOS.fpit.asm.inst3_3d_chm_Nv.GEOS5124.20180101_0000.V01.nc4\fP)

.sp
The rest of ginput expects these to be available in a specific file structure. All met files must be under a directory,
which can be anything and which we will refer to as \fB$METDIR\fP\&. Within this directory the 2D files must go in a
subdirectory named \fBNx\fP and the 3D native level files in a subdirectory named \fBNv\fP\&. Chemistry files may go in
\fB$METDIR/Nv\fP or a separate directory, \fB$CHMDIR/Nv\fP\&. The leading directory may be whatever you wish, but it must
have the \fBNv\fP subdirectory.  There are no further subdivisions within the Nx or Nv subdirectories.
.sp
The difference between the \fBgetg5\fP and \fBget\-rl\-g5\fP subcommands is that the former expects a range of dates to
download GEOS data for, while the second expects a TCCON runlog.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBDATE_RANGE\fP
Required for \fBgetg5\fP, this must be a range of dates in the form YYYYMMDD\-YYYYMMDD, for example, 20180101\-20180201.
Note that the second date \fIis exclusive\fP, meaning that (in this example) data would \fInot\fP be downloaded for
Feb 1st. This follows the standard Python convention of exclusive ranges and is generally followed throughout
ginput. Alternatively, a single date can be given (YYYYMMDD).
.TP
\fBRUNLOG\fP
Required for \fBget\-rl\-g5\fP, this must be a path to a TCCON runlog (.?rl file).
.TP
\fB\-t, \-\-filetypes\fP
Which data type of file to download. \fImet\fP will download meteorology files (2D or 3D, determined by \fB\-\-levels\fP)
and \fIchm\fP will download the chemistry files.
.TP
\fB\-l, \-\-levels\fP
Which vertical structure type of file to download. \fIsurf\fP will download the 2D files, \fIeta\fP will download the
native 72\-eta level files. \fIp\fP is a legacy option that downloads fixed\-pressure level files. These files are no
longer officially supported for ginput.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-\-mode\fP
Which GEOS files to download. \fIFP\fP is the standard forward product, while \fIFPIT\fP is the forward processing for
instrument teams product. The TCCON standard product uses FPIT data, since it covers the necessary time range for
the TCCON data record. However, FPIT requires a data subscription to access (see
\fI\%https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/GMAO_products/\fP). FP data \fIshould\fP work, but has not been as extensively tested.
\fBNote: FP is the default since it does not require a data subscription. If you are doing standard TCCON processing, this option must be set to FPIT\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-path\fP
Where to download the data to. This would be your root $METDIR or $CHMDIR from the description above; the Nv or
Nx subdirectories are created automatically. That is, \fBpath=/data/geos/met\fP would place the downloaded files in
\fI/data/geos/met/Nv\fP or \fI/data/geos/met/Nx\fP, as appropriate. If not specified, then data is downloaded to the current
directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-first\-date, \-\-last\-date\fP (get\-rl\-g5 only)
These options allow you to limit the dates that GEOS data will be downloaded for given a runlog. That is, if the
runlog has dates spanning 2000 to 2020, specifying \-\-last\-date=2010\-01\-01 will limit ginput to downloading files
to before 2010 only. By default, \fB\-\-first\-date\fP is set to 2000\-01\-01 since GEOS\-FPIT data are not available
prior to 2000. These dates must be given in YYYY\-MM\-DD format, which is currently inconsistent with the standard
date range arguments. \fBNote: whether \-\-last\-date is exclusive or inclusive has not been extensively tested and should not be relied on.\fP

.SH NOTES
.sp
There is some legacy behavior preserved if neither \fB\-\-levels\fP nor \fB\-\-filetypes\fP are specified that the 2D and
fixed\-pressure level 3D met files are downloaded. Since fixed\-pressure level 3D met files are no longer officially
supported, this will likely change in future versions and should not be relied on.
